# Landing Page Project

## Functionality

When opening the landing page project in a web browser, you have _at least_ 4 sections of content. The nav bar will be dynamically generated to ensure that each section of content is captured.

When traversing the web page, either through scrolling or clicking the navigation links, active animations will follow the user, and the navigation links will be highlighted to show where the user is currently.
